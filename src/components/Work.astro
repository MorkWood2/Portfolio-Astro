    My vocation is collaboration and clear communication, which I bring to every
    role. The values I live by are simplicity, trust, and meaningful work.

  <p class='text-2xl pt-5'>
    At Astra, I built human-centered software to support aerospace manufacturing and
    developed tools for engineers to analyze flight and test vehicle
    performance. My foundation in manufacturing stems from my time working in
    inventory, where I interacted with nearly every part of the vehicle
    throughout its development lifecycle.

    These days I mostly work up and down the IP/TCP stack — designing and maintaining the infrastructure that keeps our systems, services, and people connected.
    It's fun work, sometimes complex, and it fits my software side perfectly.
    I still code — building tools, automating fixes, scripting my way out of weird network puzzles.
    There's something satisfying about knowing how the packets move and how the software breathes on top of it all.
